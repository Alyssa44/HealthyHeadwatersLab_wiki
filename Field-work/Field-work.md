#Field Work
This section details the protocol and resources for the various types of field work conducted by the Healthy Headwaters Lab.

## General
### Safety
**ALWAYS make sure someone *not in the field* knows where you are and when you will be back. NEVER do field work alone!** 

### Before Leaving GLIER
* Make sure you have all of the supplies and equipment you need (Complete the [field work checklist])
* Sign any equipment out on the [Asana Equipment Locations Sheet](https://app.asana.com/0/1128801752832452/board)

### In the Field (general)
This gives general information for working in the field. More details on protocols for specific types of field work are given below.

### When You Return
* Check in with Catherine and anyone else who knew you were in the field
* Make sure you clean all of the items you brought into the field, put them back where they belong, and replenish any supplies you used from the field kit. 
* Sign back in any equipment you signed out on Asana.  
* If anything broke or acted funny in the field, let Alyssa know, so it can be fixed.
* If you came up with any new protocols or ideas about how to improve field work - bring them up to Catherine, and if appropriate, add them as a suggested change to the Wiki!
