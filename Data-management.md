# Data Management

### Data Storage
All data should be stored on the Healthy Headwaters Lab Dropbox in the Data folder. Each project will have its own subfolder within the Dropbox/Data folder.

#### Naming conventions
Raw data should be saved within the Dropbox/Data folder, within the "Raw data" folder and the specific project **(Or equipment??)** folder to which it pertains.  
Data should be named using the following format: FILENAME_YYYMMDD. Generally the FILENAME will be concise and descriptive and refer to the project under which it falls (e.g., SedimentP_Essex_20190715).

#### Meta-data


#### Data Templates
All raw data should be entered into the data templates available in Dropbox. This ensures that data collected for different projects are comparable at the raw data stage. When you clean up your files for analysis, you may want to hide or delete columns, but this should not be done at the raw data stage.
