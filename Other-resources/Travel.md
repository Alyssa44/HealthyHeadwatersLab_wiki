# Travel policies and resources

### Conferences
Conferences are a great way to present your work, learn about other research, and network with other researchers and practitioners. Attending conferences will often include making either an oral or poster presentation. Hwowever, tehre are numerous other benefits beyond simply presenting your work. Conferences often have professional development opportunities associated with them, valuable networking opportunities for making and strengthening professional relationships, and a venue for learning about other interesting reasearch going on outside of your direct area of focus.

#### Common conferences for the Healthy Headwaters Lab
* The [International Association for Great Lakes Research (IAGLR)](http://iaglr.org/conference/about.php), is a multi-disciplinary annual conference that alternates between Canada and the US and is mainly focused on the Laurentian Great Lakes and their basins. IAGLR offers several student scholarships and travel support.  
* The [Society for Freshwater Science (SFS)](https://freshwater-science.org/annual-meeting-info), is an international society focused on understanding freshwater ecosystems. It holds annual conferences that are usually located in the US. SFS also offers several types of student awards and support.

### Reimbursement policies
Conducting work and traveling for meetings should not place undue financial pressure on you. Whenever possible, work with Catherine or a staff member to make purchases for travel. This will avoid you incurring out-of-pocket costs and then waiting for reimbursement. If necessary, you can make pre-approved purchases on your personal cards and submit a reimbursement request. At the moment, Catherine is the only one with this authority so you will work with her to set up a suitable arrangement for expenses. 

**As a general rule, it is very important to keep all receipts, boarding passes, and agendas/conference schedules.**  

Travel expenses must be approved by Catherine. However, please note that *everyone has the leeway to spend money to avoid risk when necessary* (e.g., if unexpectedly tired on a long drive back from a meeting, you can avoid the dangers of fatigued driving by renting a cheap hotel room)   

Details on how to submit reimbursements are given in the [GLIER Student Handbook.](http://www1.uwindsor.ca/glier/glier-graduate-student-handbook)
