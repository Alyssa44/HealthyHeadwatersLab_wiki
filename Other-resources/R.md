# R and Data Analysis

#### Resources for Using R
Many resources exist for using R, and Google is your friend. We highly recommend using [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) as an interface for using R. RStudio makes it easier to see all of the pieces that you're working with in R at once.   
Here are a few good resources that we have found useful:  
* [**Stack Overflow**](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r) - Many of your questions can be answered by searching Stack Overflow
* [**R for Beginners**](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Paradis-rdebuts_en.pdf) - This document provides a basic overview of R
* **For graphing**: [**ggplot cheatsheets**](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf)
* There are also several R books in the Healthy Headwaters Lab (rm 313)
