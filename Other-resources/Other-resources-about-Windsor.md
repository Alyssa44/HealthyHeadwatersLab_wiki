So you're moving to Windsor to join the Healthy headwaters Lab - **Welcome!** Below are some resources to help you get to know your new city.

### Moving to Windsor
#### A place to live
Finding a rental in Windsor can be difficult, depending on what you want. **Do not rent a place without seeing it first**, rentals often look (and smell!) different in real life than in their photos. Some resources for finding rentals are:
* [Padmapper](https://www.padmapper.com/apartments/windsor-on)

##### Areas within Windsor
* **Walkerville** -  Walkerville is further from the University, but has a lot of nice shops, restaurants, and bars. Buses run fairly regularly to the University. The Riverfront is also a very convenient (and pretty) bike or walking path to GLIER.
* Add more! Maybe Alyssa/Candy/Jess can add more about different areas.
