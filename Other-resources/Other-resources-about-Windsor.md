So you're moving to Windsor to join the Healthy headwaters Lab - **Welcome!** Below are some resources to help you get to know your new city.

### Moving to Windsor
#### A place to live
Finding a rental in Windsor can be difficult, depending on what you want. **Do not rent a place without seeing it first**, rentals often look (and smell!) different in real life than in their photos. Some resources for finding rentals are:
* [Padmapper](https://www.padmapper.com/apartments/windsor-on)

##### Areas within Windsor
* **Walkerville** -  Walkerville is further from the University, but has a lot of nice shops, restaurants, and bars. Buses run fairly regularly to the University. The Riverfront is also a very convenient (and pretty) bike or walking path to GLIER.
* Add more! Maybe Alyssa/Candy/Jess can add more about different areas.

#### Transportation
* Buses: A bus pass is included with your student fees. The bus is relatively good for getting around the central area of Windsor, but less so further out.
** The best way to get route information/times is to use the public transport option when search directions on Google maps
* Biking: Windsor isn't the most bike friendly city, but there riverfront path is great for getting to GLIER and there's a scattering of on and off-road bike paths around the city. 
** Bike Widsor-Essex in Walkerville https://bikewindsoressex.com/ is a great source of good second hand bikes (Likely $100-$200 for one that will get you around).
** Make sure you get a good D-lock! Unfortunately bike theft is common, even around the university and GLIER. 
* Car (parking info - placeholder)
