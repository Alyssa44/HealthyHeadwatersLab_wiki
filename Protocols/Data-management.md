# Data Management

### Data Storage
All data should be stored on the Healthy Headwaters Lab OneDrive in the Data folder. Each project will have its own subfolder within the OneDrive/Data folder.

#### Raw Data
Raw data should be saved within the Shared HHL OneDrive/Data folder, within the "Raw data" folder and the specific piece of equipment folder to which it pertains. When working with the raw data, copy it into a new file for your project. This will allow raw data to be available to multiple team members. **Don't modify the raw data directly**  

#### Naming conventions
Data should be named using the following format: FILENAME_YYYMMDD. Generally the FILENAME will be concise and descriptive and refer to the project under which it falls (e.g., SedimentP_Essex_20190715).

#### Meta-data
