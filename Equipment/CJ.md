# Lab Vehicle

The Healthy Headwaters Lab has a lab vehicle named CJ (for the license plate!). Due to GLIER policies, only staff members are allowed to drive CJ. CJ is generally parked behind GLIER in the parking lot, and two sets of keys are held by Catherine and Jess Ives. When using CJ, make sure the Healthy Headwaters Lab magnets are placed on the doors so it can be identified as a University vehicle. This is especially important when parking on campus to avoid a parking ticket.  

When you use CJ, always return her with a full tank of gas (be considerate of your teammates!) (**Jess check payment for gas policies**)  

A maintenance record for CJ can be found here (PLACEHOLDER FOR LINK TO MAINTENANCE RECORD)
