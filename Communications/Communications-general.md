# Communications
As part of the Healthy Headwaters Lab, we communicate our work in a wide range of ways, including academic presentations, meetings with partners, public outreach, and social media. This file gives resources and guidelines for all of these different ways of communicating.

### Ground Rules
* Treat all communications using your UWindsor and Healthy Headwaters Lab accounts as professionally as possible.
* In-person, Asana, and email communication is preferred over texting. Save texting for immediate updates (e.g., in the field, traveling between sites, running late for a meeting).
* In case of doubt, cc: Catherine and/or the healthy.headwaters@uwindsor.ca email address
* When working with the public or within a stakeholder group, feel free to give out either the healthy.headwaters@uwindsor.ca email address or Catherine’s office phone number. When doing so, let Catherine know so she has context for any inquiries that come in.
* Be mindful of inclusive language including gender-free pronouns and your language. An elevator pitch/grandma approach to describing your science is good practice. Talking to farmers, community members, elders about your science requires practice and mindfulness about the levels and details of science being discussed. This will take practice and as a lab we will provide feedback.
* You are encouraged to use the lab logos and templates, and acknowledge the various funding sources and partnerships. Logos are saved on the Dropbox for easy access. If you find or develop a new logo, please add to them as appropriate so that others can use the same logos.


### Academic presentations
Presentations, both oral and poster, can be difficult to do well! However, with enough practice and preparation, they are a very effective way to communicate your work with others, solicit feedback, and expand your network.
When preparing a presentation, keep these deadlines in mind:
* Circulate the abstract to all co-authors more than one week before deadline. Let your co-authors know what the deadline for submission is, and make sure you will have enough time to address any comments before that deadline.
* For posters, circulate the draft poster to all co-authors at least one week before the printing deadline. Ideally, circulate it earlier than that to allow yourself time to address comments. If any comments are contentious, you may need to recirculate a revised draft version for review. **Recirculate the final poster version at least two business days before printing.**
* If you are giving an oral presentation, you should plan to give a practice presentation to the lab group at least one week before the scheduled presentation. If you are new to presenting, or unsure about the presentation matter, you should give a practice presentation two weeks before the scheduled presentation. This gives you buffer time to incorporate comments on the practice presentation and give a second practice presentation if necessary.

#### Creating good oral presentations
You are encouraged to begin each public presentation with respect and gratitude through an acknowledgement of the indigenous peoples and places. Please acknowledge the lands where you conducted the work but also where you are presenting. Please work with Candy and Catherine if you are unsure or would like some feedback and practice.

### Public outreach
Public outreach is an important part of working in this lab, and a key mechanism of our lab’s translation of research. We need to connect with people to gain public support, community buy-in, and the valuable local knowledge that is vital for building useful and needed work.
As a member of the Healthy Headwaters lab, there may be various opportunities for public outreach, both planned (e.g., community presentations, information booths at local events) and unplanned (e.g., you may be approached by neighbours while you are doing field work). You should practice explaining your work in a way that engages rather than alienates people. Avoid jargon and technical terms. Practice speaking concisely and relating your work to outcomes that matter to the audience. 

#### Social media
Social media is a type of public outreach, and an effective one at that.
